<Fern>[Happy]Hellooo, sorry I was just repotting a big plant so I’m filthy right now hahah.
* <B>I think you smell fresh and clean.
[Sad]Ah really? That isn’t quite ideal... Maybe I should jump into the mud.
* <N>You smell like dirt and roses.
[Happy]Perfect, please let me know if that changes.
* <G>Did you wash with the hose?
[Happy]Always! It rinses dirt while keeping the earthy musk, plus it’s quite fun!

- I think I’ll keep gardening for a while longer, you’re welcome to help out!
