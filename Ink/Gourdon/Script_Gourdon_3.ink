<Gourdon>And once again we meet. Just dont make too much noice, I’m trying to write something.

* <N>Are we back in the Tublur era?

* <G>That sounds really nice and therapeutic.
[Happy]Oh... I supose it is.
* <B>Now that is a waste of time.
[Sad]WELL, you dont have to do it.
 
- [Neutral]Just don’t tell people, this is only for the roof meatings.
