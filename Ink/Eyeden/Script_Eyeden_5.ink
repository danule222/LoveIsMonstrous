<Eyeden>Hey! Ramster, have you seen my sock?
* <N>Sock?
- Yeah, I keep loosing it? I had it in my locker.
* <B>Are you wearing just one sock? Kinda gross.
[Sad]Gross...
* <N>There was one hanging on the board the other day.
[Neutral]Again? Maybe I'll check that out.
* <G>Maybe a little gremlin decided to prank you and steal your socks.
[Happy]Always the left on!
 
- [Happy]Gotta go, that sock is not gonna get found by itself!
    -> END
