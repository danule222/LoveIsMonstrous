<Owlaf>Greetings %PLAYERNAME%. I wanted to speak with you. Forgive me I do not often speak with other students. I think I…bore them.
- Do you find me boring?
* <B>Every second is agony.
[Neutral]I see…
* <N>Maybe a little less, book talk?
[Neutral]I do tend to…go on, do I not.
* <G>Not at all.
[Sad]Yes, well. I suppose I will not change then.
 
- [Neutral]I will take my leave then. Goodbye %PLAYERNAME%.
    -> END
