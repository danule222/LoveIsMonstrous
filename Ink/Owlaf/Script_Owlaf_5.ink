- [Happy]Have you been up to the gardens by chance? I have been unfortunately barred from entry.
* <B>Do you want worms?
[Happy]At any given opportunity.
* <N>Banned for a reason.
[Sad]Let us not discuss such things.
* <G>No worms with me.
[Sad]Howâ€¦disappointing
 
- [Happy]For now I will continue on in quiet contemplation. Good day.
