<p>Love is Monstrous is a visual novel developed for the 2024 Global Game Jam. The game was made in barely 2 days, thanks to the efforts of 3 amazing concept artists, the best musician I've ever met, and myself, the only programmer on the project.</p>

<p>The theme of this jam was 'Make me laugh', so our idea was to make a visual novel where the characters are monsters with different personalities, putting the player in different and funny situations, where the main mission is to find love.</p>

<p>The game was made from scratch in Godot 4.2 using Ink.</p>
